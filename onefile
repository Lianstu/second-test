DESCRIPTION

You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and 
the value will be escaped.

Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the --add option. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on
multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given. Only the existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset.
If you want to handle the lines that do not match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also EXAMPLES).
